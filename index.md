# Introduction/Principles of Punishment

## Proof of Guilt: “Beyond a reasonable doubt”

**Presumption of Innocence**

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Owens v. State (1992)</b> (man sitting in non-moving car in private driveway while intoxicated)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If circumstances are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence, then a conviction upon circumstantial evidence may be sustained. While this may not prove guilt, it makes one of the two alternative inferences (guilty/not guilty)  less reasonable.</p>

# Theories of Punishment

**General:** (1) Why (and whether) the social institution of punishment is warranted; (2) What are the necessary conditions for criminal liability and punishment in particular cases; (3) What form and severity of punishment is appropriate for particular offenses and offender (p. 33).

**Retributive Justifications**
- The moral desert of an offender is a sufficient and necessary condition of liability to punitive sanctions
- Other reasons for punishment (such as crime prevention reasons) must be added to moral desert
- We have a moral duty to punish offenders
- The offender should be punished not more nor less than they deserve (punishment should fit the crime; an eye for an eye)  

**Utilitarian justifications**
- General deterrence
- Individual deterrence
- Incapacitation and other forms of risk management
- Reform

# Principles of Legality

## Legality and previously defined conduct

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Commonwealth v. Mochan (1955)</b> (Mochan said obscene and sexually suggestive things to Mrs. Zivkovich; convicted under common law of “violating public morality” [p.91]) <i>Also falls under violation of due process because vague</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> The court cannot create a crime; only the legislature can create a crime.</p>

No punishment without law: <b>NYPL § 5.05 (3)</b> “The provisions of this chapter do not apply to or govern the construction of and punishment for any offense committed prior to the effective date of this chapter, or the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense. Such an offense must be construed and punished according to the provisions of law existing at the time of the commission thereof in the same manner as if this chapter had not been enacted.”

## Due process

**Burden of proof**

- The preponderance of evidence is that whoever has the burden of proof has to prove how likely or not it is.
- In criminal law, the constitution in the due process clause requires that the burden be on the prosecution. Thus, guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden of proof for proving guilt is much higher than the burden of proof for proving innocence.

## Statute may not be vague or overbroad

**Vague**

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Commonwealth v. Mochan (1955)</b> (Mochan said obscene and sexually suggestive things to Mrs. Zivkovich; convicted under common law of “violating public morality” [p.91]) <i>Also falls under legality and previously defined conduct</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Holding:</b> Violation of due process because vague (there was no specific statute or law; the state is arguing that “Christianity is a part of the common law” and that if an act “scandalously affects the morals or health of the community,” then it can be indicted at common law (92). The dissent says that the legislature writes the law and the court enforces it. The court cannot create a crime; only the legislature can create a crime).</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>In Re Banks (1978)</b> (Peeping Tom)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If a statute is too vague or indefinite or too broad, it violates due process.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Notes:</b> In <i>In Re Banks</i> the court held that the statute is not unconstitutional because it is sufficiently definitive and does not meet the doctrine of overbreadth. Here, court reads “secretly” as “the wrongful spying upon a female with the intent of violating the female’s legitimate expectation of privacy.” Important principle that comes out is that a court may narrow and thus save a statute from being unconstitutional, because of this prior judicial interpretation. Steps: (1) Interpret statute (Does statute violate due process?); (2) is statute too vague or not definite enough or overbroad?; (3) if it is too vague, can it be saved by judicial interpretation?</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> Criminal impersonation (ignorance of the law would not be a defense because the statute is written/enacted therefore there is notice); however, the law as stated here is vague and does not specify impersonation of whom of what.</p>

**Overbroad**

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Keeler v. Superior Court (1970)</b> (struck pregnant ex-wife in belly intending to kill fetus, charged with murder)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> It is not for the court to define murder. Once legislature defined murder the court can interpret it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Notes:</b> The court held that the CA murder statute was not intended to include fetuses in the definition of human being because to apply it as if it did, would broaden the definition and exceed judicial power. (including fetuses in the definition of human being would also not provide fair warning to the defendant and would thus violate his constitutional right to due process). Dissent argued that definitions of corpse and human being have changed; in Keeler the court applied some kind of lenity doctrine so that they wouldn’t expand the definition of human being. <i>Legislature did not change the definition of human being but changed the law to include fetuses as well.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>In Re Banks</b> (Peeping Tom law not overbroad)</p>

# Statutory interpretation

Courts must interpret ambiguous statutory terms according to legislative intent. In doing so, courts may consider the ordinary definition of the term, any special definitions, definitions at the time of writing the statute, the purpose of the statute, and the legislative history.

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Garnett v. State (1993)</b> (20-year old D with cognitive disabilities had sexual intercourse with 13-year old, who became pregnant; charged with statutory rape) <i>legislative intent not to include mens rea</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> Courts should only read a mens rea requirement into a statutory rape law if the legislature clearly intended for one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Notes:</b> Defendant was found guilty of second degree rape under the “statutory rape” law of Maryland. No mens rea was required, and the statute did not allow for the affirmative defense of mistake of fact. The Court found that the statute omits mens rea in (a)(3) by legislative design, because it includes mens rea in (a)(2) of the statute.</p>

Mens rea modifying terms: look at **NYPL 15.15** last sentence – “When one and only one of such terms appears in a
statute defining an offense, it is presumed to apply to every element of the offense unless an intent to limit its application clearly appears.”

Also look at **MPC 2.02 (4)** “Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material Elements. When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears."

## Lenity doctrine

If a statute is vague or overbroad or if it can be interpreted equally to favor both parties (defendant and prosecution), it should be read and interpreted in the light most favorable to defendant.

“Criminal statutes must be strictly construed” (page 106 of Banks) (also, page 97 of Keeler (“human being” case)). Banks and Keeler mention the lenity doctrine, but it doesn’t carry much weight in those cases. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the defendant wins. It just puts a little more weight on the side of the defendant.

**NYPL Section 5.00 is the NON-INCLUSION of the lenity doctrine!**  
NYPL § 5.00 Penal law not strictly construed. "The general rule that a penal statute is to be strictly construed does not apply to this chapter, but the provisions herein must be construed according to the fair import of their terms to promote justice and effect the objects of the law.""

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Muscarello v. United States (1998)</b> (drug dealer with firearm in glove compartment of car)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If a person knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle, including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car, which the person accompanies, then they are guilty of “carrying” the firearm.</p>

# Three elements of a crime

To sustain a conviction/establish criminal culpability in any criminal case, the prosecution must prove (1) actus reus, (2) mens rea, and (3) causation beyond a reasonable doubt.

If it is a result crime, we do not need to prove causation.

# Actus Reus

**General rule:** Actus reus is a required element of every crime. Actus reus requires (1) the satisfaction of all statutory actus reus elements, and (2) either a voluntary act or an omission of duty.

## 1. Statutory Actus Reus Elements

**Steps of Analysis:**
1. Elementize the statute
2. Categorize each element (conduct, result, attendant circumstances)
3. Write a law-because-facts sentence analyzing each element

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>People v. Rizzo (1927)</b> (Rizzo and others driving around trying to find Rao to rob him of payroll. Never found Rao.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> A defendant may not be convicted of attempt unless the defendant intentionally commits an act tending to the commission of a crime, which is so near to accomplishment of the crime that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would have been committed but for timely interference. (This becomes the dangerous proximity test)</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>State v. Jack Sawyer (2018)</b> (planned a shooting at former high school; question is whether was attempting to commit a crime) (No dangerous proximity [<i>see Rizzo</i>])</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> Intent to commit a crime is not sufficient for conviction of attempt to commit a crime; if there is no actus reus there is no crime (my rule)</p>

## 2. Voluntary Act OR Omission of Duty

**NYPL Section 15.00:** Voluntary Act

“Voluntary act” means a bodily movement performed consciously as a result of effort or determination and includes the possession of property if the actor was aware of his physical possession or control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate it.

**MPC Section 2.01 (1)** Requirement of Voluntary Act
(1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.
(2) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section:

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(a) a reflex or convulsion;</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.</p>

Coercion does not make something involuntary. If someone said, “I’m going to shoot you unless you punch Prof K in the face” and you punched prof K, your act in punching him would be a voluntary act.

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Martin v State (1944)</b> (involuntarily and forcibly taken onto public highway by law enforcement officers after being arrested)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> Voluntary appearance in a public place is required to convict a person of intoxication in a public place. </p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>People v. Decina (NY) (1956)</b> (Decina voluntarily got in the car but did not voluntarily have a seizure)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> The definition of voluntary does not have any knowledge requirement. </p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> Person was knocked unconscious, kidnapped and brought to the United States. Person is arrested and charged with entering or being in the United States without proper documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If a person is not voluntarily in a public place that person cannot be unlawfully in a public place (my rule, I think). </p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> Defendant is charged with “intending to assassinate the President.” Defendant confesses to intending to assassinate the President.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If a person expressed intent in a way that signifies harm to society, is not deterred by threat of sanction, and has demonstrated an identifiable occurrence of acts following from thoughts, the person should be punished for intending to assassinate the President. </p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> California had a statute that permitted a person to be convicted for the “status” of being an addict, without requiring proof of any act whereby that person became an addict. Issue is whether someone can be criminalized for being an addict.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> The U.S. Constitution forbids punishment for a mere status </p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Reasoning:</b> Person cannot be criminalized for being something. Criminal law only punishes conduct, more precisely voluntary conduct.</p>

**Omission + Duty**

Law/statute imposes duty when a person:
- has a certain status relationship with the victim (i.e., child, elderly parent, maybe spouse; if adult sibling, no duty to care)
- assumed contractual duty of care
- voluntarily assumed duty of care
- creates risk of harm to another

**MPC Section 2.01 (3)** Omission as Basis of Liability

Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>People v. Beardsley (1907)</b> (married bartender went on drinking binge with Blanche Burns, who took morphine tablets and died)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> In order to punish a person for an omission, the person must owe a legal duty to the victim, not just a moral duty. (The duty may be imposed by law or contract, or a person may have a duty from a domestic relationship, public duty, voluntary choice).</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Pope v. State (1979)</b> (three-month-old Demiko Lee Norris died as a result of physical injuries inflicted by his mother Melissa Vera Norris at the house of Pope and witnessed by Pope)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If there is no status relationship there is no duty to act to protect an infant or child unless there is (1) assumed contractual duty of care, (2) voluntarily assumed duty of care, or (3) the risk of harm to another created by the defendant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> David Cash walked into a restroom and saw his close friend Jeffrey Strohmeyer struggling with a seven-year-old girl in a bathroom stall. Cash walked away. Strohmeyer raped and killed the girl. Las Vegas police said Cash did nothing wrong by failing to stop the crime or report it to a nearby casino security guard. (p. 146)</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> If I burned down my house I would have a duty to rescue people</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If a person creates a risk of harm to another, the person who created the risk has a duty to care for the person at risk</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> Prof K drowning; illustrates the bystander effect, and also if you try to save them you might drown too. You can’t be penalized for not acting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b>In order to punish a person for an omission, the person must owe a legal duty to the victim.</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> Barry was walking on the Coney Island boardwalk around 8 pm. No lifeguards were on duty. Suddenly, he heard frantic splashing and yelling. To his horror, a swimmer seemed to be floundering badly about 100 yards out in the water. A crowd of stricken onlookers were beginning to approach, several grumbling about having no cellphone service this far out on the beach. Seeing that he had full cell service, Barry loudly announced to the crowd, “Don’t worry, everyone, I’m calling 911 right now!” But before he could place the call, he was hit with an unstoppable craving for a hot dog. Barry left the scene, went to Nathan’s, and ordered a chili dog. While he was waiting for his food, the swimmer in the ocean drowned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Narrow Rule:</b> In New York, Barry would not satisfy the second element (voluntary act/omission plus legal duty)of actus reus</p>

**Justifications for the common law approach to punishing people for omissions (pp. 146-7)**

- Punishing people for omission increases the risk of convicting morally innocent persons
- Difficult line-drawing questions arise: for example, if a person is dying of a knife wound in a city street and 100 people walk by, who should be punished for omission?
- Bystander effect: everyone thinks someone else is going to help
- Issue of freedom: A penal law that prohibits an individual from X (i.e. killing another person) permits that individual to do anything other than X. In contrast, a law that requires a person to do Y (e.g. help a bystander) bars that person from doing anything other than Y.

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Kitty Genovese case</b> (young woman coming home late at night, attacked, neighbors yelled, walked away)</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b>Person in hallway shouting help vicious dog. Prof K in apartment, does want to get up and stop watching TV. Is Prof K legally responsible? No, he's not.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> There is no criminal liability for failure to act unless there is a legal duty to act.</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b>Same situation, but Prof K is standing with door open and looking. Person is running towards the open door chased by vicious dog, and Prof K slams the door closed. Is Prof K legally responsible? Yes, because slamming the door was a voluntary act.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If a person performs a voluntary act that results in harm to another person, the voluntary act element of actus reus is satisfied. (This doesn’t mean that there's a crime)</p>

**Distinguishing Acts from omissions**

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Barber v. Superior Court (1983)</b> (man suffered cardio-respiratory arrest during surgery resulting in severe brain damage; doctors withdrew life support)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> There is no criminal liability for failure to act unless there is a legal duty to act.</p>

# Mens Rea

**“Culpability” meaning of mens rea**
A defendant is guilty of a crime if she commits the social harm of the offense with any morally blameworthy state of mind; … not significant whether she cause the social harm intentionally or … with some other blameworthy intent (e.g. recklessly) (158). *(I'm not sure if this "culpability" meaning of mens rea is only in common law)*

**“Elemental” meaning of mens rea**
Refers to the mental state the defendant must have had with regard to the “social harm” elements set out in the definition of the offense. Using this meaning, a defendant is not guilty of an offense, even if she has a culpable frame of mind, if she lacks any mental state specified in the definition of the crime (158).

## Common Law Mens Rea

The term “mens rea,” meaning “a guilty mind; a guilty or wrongful purpose; a criminal intent,” is shorthand for a broad network of concepts encompassing much of the relationship between the individual and the criminal law. English common law; Roman law; “moral blameworthiness.” (“Once the ‘exceedingly vague’ concept of moral blameworthiness was recognized the law embarked upon the long journey of refinement and development of culpability distinctions that continues to this day.” (U.S. v. Cordoba-Hincapie, U.S. District Court, New York 1993 [p.158])

## Model Penal Code Mens Rea

**MPC Section 2.02 General Requirements of Culpability**

(1) Minimum Requirements of Culpability. Except as provided in Section 2.05, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense.

(2) Kinds of Culpability Defined.

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(a) <b>Purposely.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an offense when:</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">(i) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result; and</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">(ii) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist.</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(b) <b>Knowingly.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when:</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">(i) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">(ii) if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(c) <b>Recklessly.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(d) <b>Negligently.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.</p>

**Selected American Law Institute comments to MPC section 2.02:** (pp. 169-70)

**Purpose and knowledge:** Narrow distinction; in both purpose and knowledge there is knowledge. Knowledge is awareness that conduct is of a certain nature or that it will cause certain results.

**Recklessness:** Conscious risk creation. Recklessness resembles knowledge in that there is awareness, but the awareness is of risk. The risk must be substantial and unjustifiable. To warrant a finding of culpability, “the jury [must] be asked to measure the substantiality and unjustifiability of the risk by asking whether its disregard, given the actor’s perceptions, involved a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person in the actor’s situation would observe” (p. 171).

**Negligence:** Different in that negligence does not require awareness. When a person inadvertently creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of which he ought to be aware; and his failure to perceive [the risk] is a gross deviation from the care that would be exercised by a reasonable person in his situation (p. 171).

**Offense Silent as to Culpability:** unless the kind of culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense has been prescribed by law, it is established if a person acted purposely, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto; … since negligence is an exceptional basis of liability, it should be excluded as a basis unless explicitly prescribed (p. 172).

**MPC Section 2.02 (7)** proposes that “when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, [unless he believes that it does not actually exist].” The MPC definition of “knowingly” is similar to its definition of “recklessly” in that both require awareness. Under **NYPL**, knowledge requires awareness. If the NY legislature wanted to make someone guilty of a crime but didn’t want to adopt the broad definition of “knowingly,” how might they write the definition of a crime without changing the definition of knowingly? They could use “recklessly."

## New York Penal Law Mens Rea

**NYPL Section 15.05: Culpability; definitions of culpable mental states**
The following definitions are applicable to this chapter:

<p style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:10%;">(1) <b>Intentionally</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.</p>
<p style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:10%;">(2) <b>Knowingly</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstances exist.</p>
<p style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:10%;">(3) <b>Recklessly</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.  The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.  A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto.</p>
<p style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:10%;">(4) <b>Criminal Negligence</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">A person acts with criminal negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.  The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>State v. Nations (1984)</b>(adult dance club owner unaware of age of sixteen-year-old dancer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If the statute requires that a person acts "knowingly," or with knowledge of attendant circumstances, the person must be aware that those circumstances exist to be found culpable of the crime. If the statute contains the mens rea term "knowingly" but does not contain "recklessly," the defendant cannot be convicted of a crime whose mens rea is "recklessly." when he is aware … that those circumstances exist.”</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Note:</b> Under Missouri law, endangering welfare of a child is if a person “knowingly encourages, aids or causes a child less than 17 years old to engage in any conduct [which tends to injure a child’s welfare].” (Here, Nations was found not guilty because she was not aware of the age of the dancer; in NY she also would have been found not guilty).</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>State v. Miles (2017)</b> (Appellant said he did not know there were more than four grams of oxycodone in the package he picked up)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Narrow Rule:</b> Knowing the specific kind of illegal drug being transported when transporting more than four grams of oxycodone is not required for conviction of the crime of illegal drug trafficking as defined by section 44-53-370(e) of the South Carolina Code (179).</p>

**Presumptions of interpretation (that may be rebutted): Mens rea modifying terms:**  

*Presume modify all terms:* **NYPL 15.15** last sentence – “When one and only one of such terms appears in a
statute defining an offense, it is presumed to apply to every element of the offense unless an intent to limit its application clearly appears”

*Maybe not modify attendant circumstances:* **MPC 2.02 (4)** “Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material Elements. When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears."

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b>Going back to the burglary statute, “intentionally breaking and entering the dwelling house of another.” Suppose I were going to break into a dwelling house of another, but I thought it was a shed. I have the actus reus elements – I broke, I entered, it was a dwelling house, but I didn’t know it was a dwelling house.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Analysis:</b>A lot of courts would say that “intentionally” does not modify dwelling house; that it only modifies breaking and entering. In the Miles case, the morphine etc. was not modified by knowingly. Dwelling house and morphine are attendant circumstances. See <b>NYPL 220.20</b> subsection 4: Mens rea and Attendant Circumstances: “It is a felony to cause …. “ (drat! Switched slide)</p>

## General and Specific Intent

“Few distinctions In criminal law are more perplexing and difficult to define; … the terms … do not have universally accepted definitions.” (p. 167)

**General intent:** Any mental state that relates solely to the acts that constitute the criminal offense (in Common Law, a general intent crime would be only to show that someone was acting wickedly in the general sense; that was sufficient).

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>How to recognize general intent in a statute/sentence:</b> mens rea term + conduct; for example, "knowingly break," "intentionally steal.""</p>

**Specific intent:** This is not used by NYPL; this is history (different courts applied different definitions for “specific intent;” no universal definition). Specific intent crimes were ones which required a  a special mental element (these elevate the crime) of intent or purposely or knowingly or with recklessness or negligence or something like that, required beyond the mental state for the act of the offense. For example:

- Intent to commit a future act (i.e. assault with intent to kill);
- A special motive or purpose (i.e. humiliation – we see this in hate crimes); or
- Awareness of attendant circumstance (i.e. knowing that someone is under 18)

If the statute has any of these, the idea is that those crimes were to be punished more severely.

**Battery statute:** General intent would be to cause battery (grievous bodily harm), but specific intent would be to disfigure (check this)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> The term “malice” in a criminal statute does not mean general wickedness; it means either (1) an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that was in fact done or (2) reckless disregard of a foreseeable risk that the harm would result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Application:</b> Here, intent was inferred by “[T]he surrounding circumstances, the use of a bottle, the absence of warning and the force of the blow are facts from which the jury could reasonably infer the intent to cause permanent disability."</p>

## Transferred intent

Only applies in Model Penal Code jurisdictions! Transferred intent is built into NY second-degree murder statute **NYPL Section 125.25**

**Definition:** When a D intends to cause harm to one person but accidentally causes the same harm to another, courts typically rely on a “legal fiction” known as the “transferred intent” doctrine. Under classic formulation of common law doctrine of transferred intent, D’s guilt is “exactly what it would have been had the blow fallen upon the intended victim instead of the bystander.” (p. 165) "Peculiarly mischievous legal fiction" because it assumes D (1) could escape liability for murder if there were no transferred intent doctrine, and (2) had mens rea in relation to intended V (there is no requirement of an unlawful attempt to kill an intended victim; here, Common law speaks in terms of an unlawful attempt to kill a person, not the person intended to be killed). Also, result of crime can change. For example,

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> P threw rock at X, intending to strike him with it. P missed X, but rock hit a window and broke it. If P charged with “intentional injury to property,” should prosecutor be able to transfer intent to hit X to the window? Answer: </p>

## Strict Liability

**Factors to consider for finding strict liability** (factors that may lead a court to conclude that a statute does not require mens rea):

- statutory interpretation principles;
- congressional purpose;
- statute omits mention of mens rea;
- policy (i.e. public welfare offense);
- the standard is reasonable and proper to expect people to follow;
- the penalty is relatively small;
- the crime does not carry a heavy stigma.
- common law treatment of the crime – sometimes the court will look at how the courts handled the crime in the past.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> Mens rea is “universal and persistent in mature systems of law,” except in public welfare offenses typified only by "neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty" (i.e. public health laws, building codes, or food and drug safety laws).</p>

MPC 2.02 (3) “Culpability Required Unless Otherwise Provided. When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.”

**NYPL Section 15.15 (2):** “A statute defining a crime, unless clearly indicating a legislative intent to impose strict liability, should be construed as defining a crime of mental culpability.”

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Note:</b> The Court finds that Maryland’s rape statute omits mens rea in (a)(3) by legislative design, because it includes mens rea in (a)(2) of the statute.</p>

## Mistake of Fact

**Common Law Mistake of Fact**

(1) If no specific intent or other special mental element is required for guilt of the offense (general intent), a mistake of fact will not be recognized as an excuse unless it was based upon reasonable grounds.
(2) If the offense is a specific intent crime, a good faith mistake of fact can be a defense when it negates the mens rea requirement. 

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>People v. Navarro (1979)</b> (convicted of petty theft for stealing four beams from a construction site) (p. 205)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b>If no specific intent or other special mental element is required for guilt of the offense charged, a mistake of fact will not be recognized as an excuse unless it was based upon reasonable grounds.  (p. 207)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Note:</b> Larceny is a specific intent crime because it requires that you trespass with the intent of in the future stealing the personal property of another person. Larceny: “trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to steal the property.”</p>

**Model Penal Code Section 2.04. Ignorance or Mistake.**

(1) Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact or law is a defense if:
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(a) the ignorance or mistake negatives the purpose, knowledge, belief, recklessness or negligence required to establish a material element of the offense;  or</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(b) the law provides that the state of mind established by such ignorance or mistake constitutes a defense.</p>
(2) Although ignorance or mistake would otherwise afford a defense to the offense charged, the defense is not available if the defendant would be guilty of another offense had the situation been as he supposed.  In such case, however, the ignorance or mistake of the defendant shall reduce the grade and degree of the offense of which he may be convicted to those of the offense of which he would be guilty had the situation been as he supposed.
(3) A belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a defense to a prosecution for that offense based upon such conduct when:
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(a) the statute or other enactment defining the offense is not known to the actor and has not been published or otherwise reasonably made available prior to the conduct alleged;  or</p>
<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;">(b) he acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in (i) a statute or other enactment;  (ii) a judicial decision, opinion or judgment;  (iii) an administrative order or grant of permission;  or (iv) an official interpretation of the public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for the interpretation, administration or enforcement of the law defining the offense.
(4) The defendant must prove a defense arising under Subsection (3) of this Section by a preponderance of evidence.</p>

**NYPL Section 15.20 Effect of ignorance or mistake upon liability** (says in negative so a little harder we have to flip around)

(1) A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief of fact, unless:

<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">(a) Such factual mistake negatives the culpable mental state required for the commission of an offense; or</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">(b) The statute defining the offense or a statute related thereto expressly provides that such factual mistake constitutes a defense or exemption; or</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">(c) Such factual mistake is of a kind that supports a defense of justification as defined in article thirty-five of this chapter.</p>

(2) A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not, as a matter of law, constitute an offense, unless such mistaken belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained in (a) a statute or other enactment, or (b) an administrative order or grant of permission, or (c) a judicial decision of a state or federal court, or (d) an interpretation of the statute or law relating to the offense, officially made or issued by a public servant, agency or body legally charged or empowered with the responsibility or privilege of administering, enforcing or interpreting such statute or law.

(3) Notwithstanding the use of the term “knowingly” in any provision of this chapter defining an offense in which the age of a child is an element thereof, knowledge by the defendant of the age of such child is not an element of any such offense and it is not, unless expressly so provided, a defense to a prosecution therefor that the defendant did not know the age of the child or believed such age to be the same as or greater than that specified in the statute.

(4) Notwithstanding the use of the term “knowingly” in any provision of this chapter defining an offense in which the aggregate weight of a controlled substance or marihuana is an element, knowledge by the defendant of the aggregate weight of such controlled substance or marihuana is not an element of any such offense and it is not, unless expressly so provided, a defense to a prosecution therefor that the defendant did not know the aggregate weight of the controlled substance or marihuana.

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> If I were out walking in the week of Halloween with my baseball bat and I really truly believe in ghosts, and someone says “who” and I think they said “boo” so I hit the ghost but it turns out to be a person. It was my mistaken belief that the person who was before me was a ghost. I didn’t have the intent to kill a human being. Remember the Nations case where she thought the dancer was not underage; the firearm case; the statutory rape case; these are mistake of fact cases; they didn’t know.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> If no specific intent or other special mental element is required for guilt of the offense charged, a mistake of fact will not be recognized as an excuse unless it was based upon reasonable grounds.  (p. 207)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Note:</b> If I truly believe the person I killed was not a human being but a ghost and did not have the awareness that the person is a human being, then I am not guilty because I don’t have the mens rea. Supposing the jury believes that I really believed it was a ghost. In NY you don’t have to look for specific intent because you just look at the mens rea – the definition of knowingly sec 15.05. How do you know what somebody actually knew? It is essentially up to the jury.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Analysis:</b> Look at NYPL definition of recklessly. Did I know there was a risk? Was this a gross deviation from what a reasonable person could be expected to believe? You’d have to analyze and see. In NYPL and MPC all you have to look at is whether the offense satisfies the mens rea terms. Here, it would focus largely on whether I was aware there was a risk that the gun was loaded – defense could say there’s always a risk with a gun.</p>

**Strict liability crimes and mistake of fact**

Mistake of fact is an affirmative defense (an affirmative defense is a defense in which the defendant introduces evidence, which, if found to be credible, will negate criminal liability even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts).

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Garnett case:</b> 20-year old defendant with cognitive disabilities had sexual intercourse with 13-year old, who became pregnant) <i> See also Garnett under statutory interpretation, where there is a different rule.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> A defendant cannot have a mistake of fact defense to a strict liability crime because there is no mens rea to negate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Notes:</b> Defendant was found guilty of second degree rape under the “statutory rape” law of Maryland. Defendant argued that there was a mens rea requirement in the statute so he could say he didn’t know and argue mistake of fact. Court determined that the legislative intent was not to include mens rea. Therefore, the offense was strict liability. No mens rea was required, and the statute did not allow for the affirmative defense of mistake of fact.</p>

## Mistake of Law

Three types of mistake of law issues:

1. Mistake/ignorance of law as penal law exception (Marrero)
2. Mistake/ignorance of law as a constitutional claim (Lambert)
3. Mistake/ignorance of law as a mens rea issue (Cheek)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b>You do NOT have a mistake of law defense if you read the law wrong based on good faith and/or consultation with a lawyer, a professor, or a prosecutor.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Statute:</b>NYPL Section 15.20</b>(2) A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not, as a matter of law, constitute an offense, unless such mistaken belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained in (a) a statute or other enactment, or (b) an administrative order or grant of permission, or (c) a judicial decision of a state or federal court, or (d) an interpretation of the statute or law relating to the offense, officially made or issued by a public servant, agency or body legally charged or empowered with the responsibility or privilege of administering, enforcing or interpreting such statute or law.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Statutory interpretation:</b>NY court reads MPC into NYPL, because otherwise NYPL would be too broad. Even though the NYPL had different language than the MPC, it must have meant what the MPC meant as a matter of policy because if anyone in NY who read the statute would have had such a big defense, then this big defense would be written into the statute. NYPL has very similar language to MPC but MPC has an extra requirement that the defendant “acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous”</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Note:</b>These three elements were required to override the rule that ignorance of law is no defense:</p>

<p style="margin-left:13%; margin-right:10%;">(3) The duty to act was based on a status that wouldn’t alert an ordinary law-abiding person to the need to register (they didn’t create the duty to act)</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Note:</b> Lambert is a kind of unique case, but this is good to know; this is one instance where ignorance of the law is a defense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Cheek v. United States (1991)</b> (tax case)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Rule:</b> To satisfy the element of knowledge of a willfulness requirement in a tax law, the government must prove that the defendant had actual knowledge of the legal duty imposed by the tax law. The mens rea of tax laws do not require that a defendant's interpretation of tax laws be reasonable. The mens rea of tax laws require knowledge of law (this is because tax laws are complex so there is a higher threshold). </p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Statute:</b> Any person “who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof ... shall be guilty of a felony." (Title 26, 7201 of the USC)</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Statutory interpretation:</b> Willfulness is the “voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty” so the language in the statute actually requires a knowledge of the law; in Cheek, the court uses a definition of “willfully” from precedent U.S. v. Bishop (p. 224). The court held that even if unreasonable, an objective belief could negate the mens rea requirement of the willfulness element of the statute. Therefore, the court reversed case because the statute has the word “willfully” that serves a mens rea purpose, needed to find guilt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Note:</b> This is very rare; but the legislature can make a law require knowledge of law in, for example, the cases of tax codes.

It relates to having a duty; even though it’s an omission, it relates to people having a duty.</p>

# Causation

The reason causation is important is because the statute is prohibiting a result, not a conduct. If the statute prohibits a result, for fairness purposes, there has to be a connection established between the cause and the result.

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> Suppose a neighborhood not much traffic A B C D E driving around. E gets hit by a car. Nobody sees. Even E doesn’t see who hit him. Would it be fair to punish all of them? No. Retributive reason: only one person deserves to be punished. Utilitarian reason could be that if we punish everyone they will all be more careful; but that would not be ok if punishment is severe for retributive reasons. </p>

## Causation: steps of analysis

**ONE DEFENDANT AT A TIME:** 1 defendant, 1 crime, 1 analysis. Then go on to the next. If one of the two big elements not satisfied, causation not satisfied.

## 1. Actual causation (cause-in-fact)

**a. But-for test**
Rule: A defendant’s conduct is a cause-in-fact of the prohibited result if the said result would not have occurred “but for” (in the absence of) the defendant’s conduct (if satisfied move on to proximate cause)
1.	If the harm would not have occurred “but for” D’s conduct, the D is the actual cause (note that there may be more than 1 actual cause)
2.	If the harm would have occurred but for D’s conduct, the D is not the actual cause

**b. Substantial factor test**

1. If the D was a substantial factor in bringing about the result, then the D is an actual cause (narrow!)
2. Rule: Where two D’s are acting independently and not in concert AND commit two separate acts, each of which alone is sufficient to bring about the prohibited result, if the defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the result, then the defendant is an actual cause. (for analysis number and think through the pieces)
(a)	If the defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the result, then the defendant is an actual cause. (move on to proximate cause)
(b)If the defendant was not a substantial factor in bringing about the result, then the defendant is not an actual cause.

**c. Acceleration test** (variation on but-for test)
i.	Rule: If one person brings about an act sufficient to bring about a prohibited result, and the defendant performs an act that accelerates the prohibited result, the defendant is the actual cause.
a.	Narrower rule: A nonlethal injury inflicted by the D after a lethal injury inflicted by someone else is a cause in fact of the V’s death if it accelerates the V’s death.

**Sometimes use substantial factor test first, before but-for test** (Velazquez case) Part 1 (when it applies)

**Rule:** (sorta) Where two D’s are acting independently and not in concert AND commit two separate acts, each of which alone is sufficient to bring about the prohibited result … Then, you apply the substantial factor/inquiry test instead of the but-for test …
Under this specific situation, if the defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the result, then the defendant is an actual cause. (Velasquez v. State)

<p style="margin-left:7%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Hypo:</b> Suppose both M and R shot K at the exact same time. But for M shooting K, would he not have died? K would have died anyway – same with R. This is when the substantial factor test would apply. Each act is sufficient to bring about K’s death.</p>

## 2. Proximate causation

**Proximate Cause analysis: are there any intervening cause(s)?**
Proximate cause is a fairness limitation for determining who among those that satisfy the but for standard should be held accountable for resulting harm.

**Rule:** If there are no intervening causes, the D that is an actual cause is also said to be the proximate cause.

**Coincidental/responsive test: steps**

i.	If there was an intervening cause, analyze the chain of causation.
1. identify intervening causes
2. determine whether each intervening cause is coincidental or responsive in relation to defendant’s act(s).
3. then,
- for coincidental, d is not a proximate cause if the intervening cause is unforeseeable.
- for responsive intervening causes (causes that are responsive in relation to D’s acts), D is not a proximate cause if the intervening cause is unforeseeable AND abnormal (Reasonable foreseeability - standard for determining whether an intervening cause supersedes - is whether the intervening cause was foreseeable based on an objective standard of reasonableness.)

**Responsive intervening cause:** A responsive intervening cause happens in response to the D’s conduct.

**First step of analysis:** Was the responsive intervening cause unforeseeable and abnormal?

**Rule:** if a responsive intervening cause is unforeseeable and abnormal (abnormal would be, an exception to whatever happened every single time in the past 99.9 percent of the rule; would have to fall way outside the expected result), it supersedes the D’s conduct as the proximate cause of the prohibited result.

**Coincidental intervening cause:** A coincidental intervening cause would have happened anyway.

**First step of analysis:** Was the coincidental intervening cause unforeseeable?

**Rule:** if a coincidental intervening cause is unforeseeable, it breaks the chain of causation.(unforeseeable is a pretty difficult test; coincidental intervening cause tends to break the chain of more easily than responsive ones)

**Proximate Cause factors/tests**

**Factors that weigh in favor of finding defendant was NOT a proximate cause** (i.e. these break the chain of causation)

**Apparent safety (victim) doctrine:** When a D’s active force has come to rest in a position of apparent safety, the court will follow it no longer (238) (People v. Rideout: V had come to rest in a position of apparent safety on the side of the road when they went to check on D.)

Voluntary human intervention: Free, deliberate and informed human intervention by interventor (State v. Presler - woman who freezes to death)

**Factors that weigh in favor of finding defendant WAS a proximate cause** (i.e. these generally do not break the chain of causation)

- De minimis contribution by intervening cause (if a few seconds difference courts can say not superseding)
- Intended consequences of defendant doctrine (mother wanting to poison someone) (p. 241)
- Omissions by interventor – note 5 on page 241 (omissions are less likely to break the chain of causation)

**Oxendine v. State | Supreme Court of Delaware, 1987**
Convicted of manslaughter in the beating death of his six-year-old son. Girlfriend had pushed Oxendine’s son into bathtub causing microscopic tears in intestines which led to peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum [membrane lining the cavity of the abdomen and folded over the viscera]). When Oxendine got home he saw Jeffrey had bruises. Early next morning Oxendine beat Jeffrey. Later that day Jeffrey’s abdomen became swollen. At 5 PM Oxendine got home, and Tyree urged him to take Jeffrey to the hospital. Instead, Oxendine went out and bought a newspaper. When Oxendine returned home, Tyree had got Jeffrey ready to go to the hospital. On the way to the hospital Jeffrey stopped breathing and when they got to the hospital he was dead. (228-9) The jury returned verdicts of manslaughter against Oxendine and Tyree. (230)
Issue: Whether the trial court committed error by denying Appellant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the issue of causation. Appellant argued that the State’s medical testimony was too vague and uncertain to show which of the codefendant’s repeated beatings caused the death. (228)
“But-for” Test: But for the infliction of the second injury, would Jeffrey have died when he did? (231) The doctors are unclear. The case doesn’t pass the “but-for” test.
**Rule:** If a person suffers a lethal injury, and the defendant subsequently inflicts a non-lethal injury that accelerates the death of the person, the defendant is an actual cause.
Holding: “The evidence upon causation was insufficient to sustain … conviction of manslaughter, but … the evidence was sufficient to sustain [Appellant’s] conviction of … assault in the second degree” (228)
Reasoning: There was acceleration, but Dr. Hoffman’s testimony that there was acceleration was not admitted because State had already closed the case-in-chief. It could not admit the prima facie case of Dr. Hoffman to support acceleration.
Judgment: Oxendine was convicted of assault in the second degree.

    **People v. Rideout | Court of Appeals of Michigan 2006**
      Rideout (D) driving SUV. Turns and drives into path of oncoming car driven by Reichelt. Reichelt’s car hits D’s SUV and comes to rest in the middle of the road. SUV came to rest on the side of the road. Reichelt and passenger Jonathan Kaiser not injured. They walk to D’s SUV on the side of the road to check on D. Spoke with D. Walked back to Reichalt’s car. Reichalt said he wanted to turn on the flashers and was standing next to his car when oncoming car driven by Tony Welch hit Keiser and killed him. D tested positive for alcohol. D was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) or while visibly impaired (OWVI) and thereby causing death.
      Issue: Did Rideout cause Kaiser's death?
      **Holding:** Court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish proximate cause. Whether intervening cause was responsive or coincidental in this case is arguable at best (238)
      Trial court improperly instructed jury on causation (court only instructed jury on cause-in-fact, not on proximate cause and superseding cause)
      Insufficient evidence of causation to prove D’s guilt
      Factual cause not in dispute; D’s driving was the but-for cause of the second accident
      Proximate cause harder to establish
      Victim’s injury must be “a direct and natural result” of D’s actions (236)
      Intervening cause (was there an intervening cause?)
      If an intervening cause superseded the D’s act as a legally significant causal factor, then the D’s conduct will not be deemed a proximate cause of the victim’s injury. (236)

    **State v. Presler 1856** (page 238) (also note 7 on page 242)
      Woman who flees abusive partner and freezes to death because chooses not to go to father’s house.
      *Voluntary human intervention*
      Page something – if taken to get medical assistance and doctor wants to help but I say no and die, then my free, deliberate and informed human intervention broke the chain of causation, and it’s no longer the D’s fault I died.

    **Velazquez v. State 1990**
      Velazquez met Alvarez at a restaurant in Florida. They decided to have a drag race with their respective cars. They “set up” the race (I understand this means they agreed on the route of the race) together. They raced a quarter mile. Alvarez turned the car around and went back down the public road. Velazquez followed him. They drove back to the starting line at 123 mph, Alvarez in front. At end of road both drivers braked but neither could stop. Alvarez crashed through a guardrail and his car flew over the canal, landing on the far bank. He was thrown from his car, then the car landed on him, and he died instantly. D also drove through guardrail but landed in canal and swam to safety.
      Statute/common law: “Vehicular homicide” is the killing of a human being by the operation of a motor vehicle by another in a reckless manner likely to cause the death of, or great bodily harm to, another.”
      Issue: whether a D driver of a motor vehicle who participates in a reckless and illegal “drag race” on a public road may be properly convicted of vehicular homicide for the death of a co-participant in the race if the sole basis for imposing liability is the defendant’s participation in said race (244)
      **Rule:**
      Even where a D’s conduct is a cause-in-fact of a particular result, Florida declines to impose criminal liability
        1.	Where the prohibited result of the D’s conduct is beyond the scope of any fair assessment created by the D’s conduct; or
        2.	Where it would otherwise be unjust, based on fairness and policy considerations, to hold the D criminally responsible for the prohibited result (245)
      D’s participation in race was a but-for cause-in-fact of V’s death.
      Drag race was over when V sped back to the starting line, so this was apparent safety
        Applying responsive/coincidental intervening cause test:
          1. Identify intervening cause
          1. Was the intervening cause responsive or coincidental
            a.	coincidental
              i.	Was it unforeseeable or abnormal?
                1. Yes
                  a.	Breaks chain of causation. Velazquez not responsible for V’s death
      Defendant’s voluntary act: drag racing
      Intervening cause: victim turns car around and speeds back
      Result: death

    **State v. Rose | Supreme Court of Rhode Island 1973**
      Henry Rose charged with leaving the scene of an accident, death resulting, in violation of General Law of Rhode Island 1956 Section 31-26-1; negligent manslaughter
      V was a pedestrian crossing a road at 6:30 pm. D drove a car towards V, hit the victim with the car, causing the V’s body to be thrown up over the hood of the car. D stopped the car momentarily. Body of V rolled off hood. D drove off again. Bus driver witnessed it all but was unable to find V’s body. At 6:40 pm police found D’s car, parked on a street about 610 feet from scene of accident. Police found body of V wedged beneath the car.
      D argued that could not be negligent manslaughter if V died upon impact. If V died upon impact, the conduct of the D in driving with V wedged under his car did not constitute culpable negligence.
      Medical evidence says V “could have” died immediately on impact. Court unable to conclude time of death on medical evidence. “where the evidence adduced by the state and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, even when viewed in a light most favorable to the state, are insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the court must grant the D’s motion for a directed verdict.” (249)
      Court should not have denied D’s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.
      New York Penal Law Section 125.10 Criminally negligent homicide: “A person is guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he causes the death of another person. Criminally negligent homicide is a class E felony.”
      Guilty when: with criminal negligence he causes the death of another person
      The timing is important because Rose was not negligent at the time he hit the person. Rose was negligent when he dragged the body, but if the person was already dead when he dragged him he did not cause the death when negligent.
      The court is reversing because you have to have all the elements of the crime at the same time. You have to have actus reus, mens rea and causation. Here they weren’t able to prove the mens rea.

    **Seinfeld hypo**
      Jerry and Elaine on speedboat, Jerry driving. Crashes speedboat. Jerry drives her to hospital. Doctor operates. Does some medical malpractice that causes elaine to die. Elaine was in the hospital getting surgery in response to jerry’s crashing the boat and injuring her.
      This doctor was usually a really good surgeon and never messed up. Doctor’s malpractice was unforeseeable, so it breaks the chain of causation.
      BUT if a bunch of gunmen go into the hospital and shoot Elaine, or if the hospital is struck by lightning and burns down and Elaine dies in the fire, it breaks the chain of causation.

      In Kentucky, wanton endangerment is defined as “a person, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, who deliberately engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person.”

    **Hypo** (p. 232)
      A.	Was D a cause? Yes. But-for test
      Was X a cause? Yes. We apply a different test.
      B.	Yes. We are only looking at the cause of death.
      C.	D was not an actual cause
      D.	Yes, but not substantial factor test because each wound independently was not enough to kill the V. So we use two but-for tests. Would V have died had D not stabbed? No. Would V have died had X not stabbed? No. so both satisfy but-for test
      E.	Yes. Substantial factor test.

# Criminal Homicide

  **Types of Criminal Homicide**
    England common law four types of murder:
      - Intent-to-kill;
      - Intent to cause grievous bodily harm;
      - Depraved heart murder;
      - Intent to commit a felony.

    Manslaughter (review casebook description pp 253-54). Types of killings involved:
      - Homicide in heat of passion;
      - From act unduly dangerous to life or limb;
      - Misdemeanor manslaughter.

    Model penal code some similarities with common law not surprising because model penal code’s purpose was to improve upon common law.

  **III.UNINTENDED KILLINGS:UNLAWFUL CONDUCT(FELONY MURDER: TO BE COVERED)**

## Common Law origins

  At common law, murder was defined as the unlawful killing of another human being "with malice aforethought."

  The classic definition of murder is provided by Sir Edward Coke in Institutes of the Laws of England (1797):

    Murder is when a man of sound memory, and of the age of discretion, unlawfully killeth within any country of the realm any reasonable creature in *rerum natura* under the King’s peace, with malice aforethought, either expressed by the party or implied by law, so as the party wounded, or hurt, etc. die of the wound or hurt, etc. within a year and a day after the same.

  Whatever the meaning, "malice aforethought" became an arbitrary symbol used by judges to signify any number of mental states deemed sufficient to support liability for murder. Generally, four states of mind:

    1. Intent to kill, including awareness that the death of another would result from one's actions, was sufficient for murder exept when death of another was caused in the heat of passion.
    2. Intent to cause grievous bodily harm, including awareness that the grievous bodily harm of another would result from one's actions was sufficient for murder if death resulted.
    3. Depraved heart murder was unintentional homicide under circumstances evincing a "depraved mind" or an "abandoned and malignant heart." Essential concept was one of extreme recklessness regarding homicidal risk. Thus, a person might be liable for murder without intent if he caused the death of another in a manner exhibiting a "wanton and wilful disregard of an unreasonable human risk."
    4. Murder based on intent to commit a felony: strict liability.

## The protected interest: “human being”

      **People v. Eulo | Court of Appeals of New York, 1984**
        Issue: Whether causing an injury that later led to death can be considered manslaughter
        Facts: Eulo and Bonilla similar cases: accused shot V in head; V taken to hospital in unconscious state and placed on respirator; doctors found that V’s brain had irreversibly ceased to function; with consent of next of kin V declared dead; artificial respirator “terminated” (cardiorespiratory machine removed/turned off); organs removed for transplantation.
        Ordinarily, death is defined as irreversible cardiorespiratory repose. When heartbeat and breathing are maintained by machines life is ambiguous, but accepted medical practice determines that death occurs when brain ceases to function (267).
        **Rule:**
        Judgment: each D’s conduct caused the V’s death and the medical procedures were not superseding causes of death. (269)
        Reasoning: NYPL Section 125 defines homicide in terms of “conduct which causes the death of a person.” In NY, the term “death” is used in many statutes but has never been defined by the legislature. Therefore, the term must be read in accordance with the apparent purpose of the statute in which it is found. (266).
        Legislative void: NY Legislature could have expressly recognized brain-based criteria for recognizing death (there were bills on the table) but did not.
        Court held that recognition of brain-based criteria for death is “not unfaithful” in prior judicial definitions of death. (267).
        **NYPL Section 1.05**
          In NYPL Section 1.05, the general purposes of penal law include (1) “To proscribe conduct which unjustifiably and inexcusably causes substantial harm to individual or public interests;” Therefore, here, to construe homicide statute to provide for criminal responsibility for homicide when a defendant’s conduct causes injury leading to the victim’s total loss of brain functions, is entirely consistent with the Legislature’s concept of death” (268).

          Reasoning: In this case, the juries were not instructed as to the appropriate criteria for determining death (268).
          Court defined criteria of death in relation to the chain of causation. “By specifically charging the juries that they might consider the surgical [transplantational] procedures as superseding cause of death, the courts made clear by ready implication that death should be deemed to have occurred after all medical procedures had ended” (268).
          Brain-based criteria for determining death are supplemental to traditional criteria: **OR, not AND**. Death is determined by either criteria. However, medical testimony diagnosing victims as dead before medical intervention is highly relevant in chain of causation, because that testimony is what caused the victims to be removed from cardiorespiratory machines. But if Vs were properly diagnosed as dead, organ removal would not have caused death. If V not dead until heart stopped V not dead when doctors surgically intervened, so surgical intervention was an intervening cause.
          If deaths were prematurely diagnosed due to a doctor’s negligence, that negligence would not be a superseding cause relieving Ds of liability for death.
          If deaths were prematurely diagnosed due to a doctor’s gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing, the intervening medical procedure would interrupt the chain of causation and become the legal cause of death.          

      **Year-and-a-day-rule** (note 3 p.269); common law
        If M shot K in chest and K died more than a year and a day after, then M cannot be convicted of murder. Could be convicted of attempted murder or something else.

# Intentional Killings: Murder

  Our casebook organizes around: intentional homicides versus unintentional homicides. We should follow the text book in terms of outlining – because this helps us see if it was an intended death or an accidental death and that will take us in different ways – and then heat of passion which are manslaughters but they are intentional too; same with unintentional; is this a depraved indifference killing, or is this a reckless manslaughter type killing or is this a criminally negligent death.

    **State v. Guthrie 1995 | Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia 1995**
      Issue: Whether Guthrie committed first degree or second degree murder when he stabbed Farley to death
      Facts: Guthrie and Farley were dishwashers who generally got along well. They were at work. Guthrie was in a bad mood. Farley poked fun at Guthrie and snapped him with a dishtowel several times. The dishtowel touched Guthrie on the nose (Guthrie was obsessed with his nose – body dysmorphic disorder). Guthrie pulled knife out of pocket and stabbed Farley to death. Guthrie suffered from panic attacks, chronic depression and borderline personality disorder.
      Procedural history: Guthrie convicted of first degree murder. Appealed, arguing that the terms willful, deliberate and premeditated were equated with a mere intent to kill (271).
      **Rule:** Any interval of time between the forming of the intent to kill and the execution of that intent, which is of sufficient duration for the accused to be fully conscious of what he intended, is sufficient to support a conviction of first degree murder. (273)
      Holding: judgment of trial court is reversed, case remanded for a new trial.       
      Court had defined premeditation very broadly in jury instruction; defense said that there has to be some time for deliberation; Jury was instructed that in order to find D guilty of first degree murder it had to find five elements beyond a reasonable doubt, and instructed that murder in the first degree is when someone kills another person
      - Unlawfully
      - Willfully
      - Maliciously
      - Deliberately
      - Premeditatedly
      The trial court had defined these terms for the jury, saying that
        For a killing to be premeditated. it is only necessary that the intention to kill be present before the act and need exist only for an instant; (271)
        Shroder definition (State v. Shroder): Willfull, premeditated and deliberate was essentially “knowing” and “intentional” (272)
        Distinction between first and second degree murder not drawn;
        Deliberate: Appellant argues that in State v. Dodds the act must have been deliberated (thought about) and there must be a plan of destruction; (272)
        Appeals court finds that it cannot abolish the distinction between first and second degree murders because of separation of powers (legislature makes laws, courts interpret). Believes Shroder definition is wrong. Makes some modifications to homicide common law.

        Morrin (note 3) a reasonable person would have time to contemplate what they are doing; to premeditate is to think about beforehand; to deliberate is to measure and evaluate the major facets of a choice or problem … [although the time in not exact,] the interval between initial thought and ultimate actions should be long enough to afford a reasonable [person] time to subject the nature of his response to a “second look” (I think this is footnote 3 to Guthrie)

    **Midgett v. State | Supreme Court of Arkansas 1987**
      Midgett physically abused his eight-year-old son regularly. One day after beating the child in the stomach, Midgett caused abdominal hemorrhage. Took son to hospital. Child died. Charged with murder in the first degree.
      Court found that the father did not premeditate killing the child; he intended to keep him alive so he could keep on abusing him.
      **Rule:** The crime of first degree murder generally requires the killing to be premeditated and deliberate.

    **State v. Forrest | Supreme Court of North Carolina 1987**
      Son killed his dying father in hospital by shooting him four times in the head.
      Premeditation and deliberation must be proved by circumstantial evidence.
      Factors in State v. Forrest to consider when determining premeditation:
      - No provocation by deceased;
      - Conduct and statements by the defendant;
      - Threats and declarations by the defendant;
      - Ill-will between the parties;
      - Lethal blows after the deceased has been rendered helpless;
      - Brutal manner;
      - Nature and number of wounds.
      Court ultimately found that D did premeditate and deliberate. Convicted of murder in the first degree.
      Dissent: it should have been manslaughter, because the required malice was not present. Killing a loved one to end their suffering should not be murder in the first degree.
      Note: This case was ruled under the North Carolina murder statute. With the MPC the outcome would have been different because the MPC does not have degrees of murder, and the MPC has the extreme emotional disturbance defense (EED).

    **Which murder provisions of the NYPL and MPC requires premeditation and deliberation?**
      NONE
      NYPL has first degree but does not have the words premeditation and deliberation
      MPC does not have degrees of murder
      The old common law did not have premeditation and deliberation either; it had malice aforethought but not premeditation and deliberation

    **Sundance hypo** (quiz question 2 put by K on twen)
      The D would argue that knowingly modifies the phrase “deadly weapon” under NYPL. Therefore, he does not satisfy the mens Rea requirements because he did not know that the phone was also a gun.

## Model Penal Code Sections 210.1 - 210.4

  Model Penal Code § 210.1. Criminal Homicide.
  (1) A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.
  (2) Criminal homicide is murder, manslaughter or negligent homicide.

    Note: MPC § 210.1 Criminal homicide defines murder similarly to common law.

  Model Penal Code § 210.2. Murder.
  (1) Except as provided in Section 210.3(1)(b), criminal homicide constitutes murder when:
  (a) it is committed purposely or knowingly; or
  (b) it is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness and indifference are presumed if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious escape.
  (2) Murder is a felony of the first degree [but a person convicted of murder may be sentenced to death, as provided in Section 210.6].

    Note: MPC  § 210.2 (b) “recklessly with extreme indifference to human life” is the MPC version of “depraved heart”/”malignant heart” in common law; also 210.2 (b) similar in some ways to felony murder but not identical to felony murder; common law felony murder is strict liability; MPC while attempting to commit robbery, etc., does require mens rea.

  Model Penal Code § 210.3. Manslaughter.
  (1) Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when:
  (a) it is committed recklessly; or
  (b) a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.
  (2) Manslaughter is a felony of the second degree.

    Note: MPC § 210.3 manslaughter again has some similarities to common law – homicide in heat of passion – MPC under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse.

  Model Penal Code § 210.4. Negligent Homicide.
  (1) Criminal homicide constitutes negligent homicide when it is committed negligently.
  (2) Negligent homicide is a felony of the third degree.

## New York Penal Law Sections 125.0 - 125.27 and notes

The fact that homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance constitutes a mitigating circumstance reducing murder to aggravated manslaughter in the first degree or manslaughter in the first degree and need not be proved in any prosecution initiated under this subdivision.
    Aggravated manslaughter in the first degree is a class B felony.

  **New York Penal Law § 125.25 Murder in the second degree**
    A person is guilty of murder in the second degree when:
    1. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person; except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that:

    Murder in the first degree is a class A-I felony.

  **List of statutes I need to know for midterm**
    I should know these by heart:
    NYPL § 125.25 Murder in the second degree
    Subsections (1), (2), and (3)
    NYPL § 125.20 Manslaughter in the first degree
    Subsections (1) and (2)
    NYPL § 125.15 Manslaughter in the second degree
    Subsection 1
    NYPL § 125.10 Criminally negligent homicide

    Notes:
    Felony murder or depraved indifference murder or intent to kill murder in new York are all second-degree murder.
    NYPL manslaughter also similarities with MPC and common law
    NY aggravated homicides – certain individuals are entitled to more protection, so killing a police officer or a peace officer
    NY first-degree murder – this is new York’s death penalty statute – basically second degree intent to kill plus aggravating factor, which can include various categories – killing a child, killing by torture, but we are not going to focus on those but I should glance at them

## Intentional Killings: Manslaughter: Heat of Passion

  **Common law Heat of Passion (voluntary manslaughter)**
    Intentional homicide done in a (1) sudden heat of passion caused by (2) adequate provocation, (3) before there has been a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool; (4) causal connection between provocation and act.
    (1)Excuse (2) justification (3) justification

  **Excuse and justification defenses**
    Justification defenses (approval of actor’s conduct, as in self-defense)
    Excuse defenses (defendant did wrong act but is not morally blameworthy, as in insanity defense)

    Is heat of passion a partial justification or a partial excuse defense?
    Why does that matter? Well, imagine a situation where a D is Aaron, and Ben drives up and kills Aaron’s daughter Sue, and Ralph steps in and tries to get past Ralph to kill Ben, and kills Ralph. Should that be an excuse defense or a justification defense? If excuse, not morally blameworthy because very upset. If excuse defense,

    **Girouard v. State | Court of Appeals of Maryland 1991**
      Issue: Whether words alone are a provocation adequate to justify a conviction of murder in the second degree.
      Holding: The provocation of Steven by Joyce was not sufficient to mitigate the second-degree murder charge against Steven to voluntary manslaughter.
      **Rule:** Words alone are not adequate provocation to mitigate second-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter. Also, one of the questions this case leaves us with is, what is a reasonable man.
      Common law: voluntary manslaughter: “an intentional homicide, done in a sudden heat of passion, caused by adequate provocation, before there has been a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool” (285). Difference between murder and manslaughter is the presence or absence of malice.
      Facts: Steven and Joyce Girouard married. Argued a lot. Steven got home and heard Joyce on phone telling friend she would leave Steven. Steven went into the bedroom and lay down. Joyce followed him in, stepped onto the bed, pulled his hair and verbally taunted him, saying she wished she had never married him and wanted a divorce. Steven picked up a pillow, went into the kitchen, got a knife, and went back into the bedroom with the knife concealed behind the pillow. Joyce continued to verbally taunt him. Steven stabbed Joyce 19 times. Then he took a shower, tried to kill himself, and called the police to say I murdered my wife. At trial, a psychologist testified that in his opinion Steven had reached the limit of his ability “to bottle up strong emotions.” (284 bottom para).
      In his appeal, Steven argued that the conviction of second degree murder should be mitigated to manslaughter because there was no malice. He acknowledged that traditionally this mitigation is limited to circumstances of
      - Extreme assault or battery upon the defendant;
      - Mutual combat;
      - Defendant’s illegal arrest;
      - Injury or serious abuse of a close relative of the defendant; or
      - The sudden discovery of a spouse’s adultery.
      Steven argued that the verbal provocation was sufficient, and that categories of provocation to mitigate should be broadened.
      The court countered by stating that although there is no finite list of legally adequate provocations, under common law, words spoken by the victim, no matter how abusive or taunting, are not sufficient to mitigate murder to manslaughter. The court argued that if words were deemed sufficient to mitigate, “nearly every domestic argument ending in the death of one party could be mitigated to manslaughter” (285).

  **Who is the reasonable person?**

    The book doesn’t really tell us. Historically in common law, if you’re thinking of the reasonable person are we thinking about an objective sort of blank person, or do we give the reasonable person some of the characteristics of the D?

    Courts generally have said that if a characteristic is related to the provocation, it should be considered in the reasonable person standard. (See note 4 p. 298)

    You have to look at what the characteristics were, and consider

    **Director of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin | House of Lords 1978**
      Khan, a middle-aged man sodomized Camplin, a 15-year-old boy, in Khan’s home, and then laughed at him. Camplin took a heavy kitchen pan and killed Khan. Camplin was charged with murder. Appealed, arguing that conviction should be reduced to manslaughter.
      Holding: Court reduced murder to manslaughter.
      **Rule:** A “reasonable man” is a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the acccused’s characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation (p. 299)

      MPC and NYPL do it a little differently, but generally juries are less likely to raise issues about sex or age.

## Extreme emotional disturbance

  MPC takes a little different approach from NYPL (see MPC and NYPL laws above)

    **People v. Cassassa | Court of Appeals of New York, 1980**
      Facts: Victoria Le Consolo (Victim) and Victor Cassassa (Defendant) lived in the same building. After dating for 3 or 4 months, Ms. Le Consolo told the D she was not in falling in love with him. D became obsessed with Ms. Le Consolo. On one occasion the D broke into the apartment below Ms. Le Consolo’s to eavesdrop, and on another occasion broke into her apartment and lay in her bed. One evening D went to Ms. Le Consolo’s apartment with bottles of wine and liquor which he wanted to give to Ms. Le Consolo. Ms. Le Consolo refused to accept the wine and liquor. D pulled out a steak knife and stabbed Ms. Le Consolo several times in the throat, then dragged her body to the bathroom and submerged it in water “to make sure she was dead.”
      Procedural history: At trial, D did not contest the facts, but argued that at the time of the killing he was experiencing extreme emotional disturbance. At trial, D had one witness, a psychiatrist, who testified that Ms. Le Consolo’s rejection of D combined with his “personality attributes” caused him to be under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the killing (301).
      The People had several witnesses including a psychiatrist, who testified that in his opinion D was not under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for the purposes of mitigation, because the disturbed state was due to internal factors, not external ones.
      Trial court noted that extreme emotional disturbance could be caused by a series of events but D had the burden of showing that his reaction was reasonable. Trial court found that D’s reaction to events were so personal to him as not to be reasonable and convicted D of murder in the second degree (301).
      **Rule:**
      Reasoning: On Appeal, D said that trial court erred. D held that he had a mental infirmity that did not rise to the level of insanity, and within that mental state, from his subjective point of view, his reaction to a series of events causing him to kill V was reasonable. NYPL Section 125.25 (1)(a) provides that it is an affirmative defense to the crime of murder in the second degree where “the defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.” (301) The extreme emotional disturbance defense is an outgrowth of the heat of passion defense.
      In heat of passion defense, response to provocation; a cooling off period completely negates the mitigating effect of the response to provocation.
      In extreme emotional disturbance defense, it may be that significant mental trauma has affected D’s mind for a substantial period of time. The standard by which the reasonableness of the D’s reaction is tested is entirely subjective (302). Under the MPC, defense of extreme emotional disturbance the D must have
      Acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance; and
      There must have been a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant’s situation as the D believed them to be.
      Test is in part subjective, and in part objective. The intention of the statute is to give the jury the opportunity to weigh facts and exercise mercy. Appeals court finds that trial court had the opportunity to do all of this and found that the D’s conduct was not reasonable even if seen from the D’s subjective viewpoint.

      MPC Sec. 210.3 does not use heat of passion; uses something similar: extreme emotional disturbance. Note that MPC says that extreme emotional disturbance can be a defense to all types of murder, including recklessness.
      NYPL Secs 125.25; 125.27 – NYPL says only applies to intentional murder, not recklessness.
      NYPL Sec 125.20 (2) mentions EED in the manslaughter statute because it refers back to second degree murder in 125.25 – so EED does not apply to 125.20(1) but it does apply to 125.20(2) because 125.20(2) is second degree murder reduced to manslaughter (125.20(2) and 125.25 EED are basically the same thing)

      **Model Penal Code § 210.3. Manslaughter.**
      (1) Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when:
      (a) it is committed recklessly; or
      (b) a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.
      **NYPL § 125.25 Murder in the second degree (1)**
        “it is an affirmative defense that:(a)(i) The defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.”
      **Compare with common Law:**
        Heat of passion only applied to intentional murders
      MPC makes some distinctions from common law; MPC is trying to incorporate more modern understandings of psychology, trying to understand that in certain circumstances words might be enough; if someone came in and said  hey I killed your child, and D loses it; in common law words were not enough, but MPC recognizes that words may be enough, and also says well, as a general matter, it should be a general rule that time makes everything better, but actually this is not a general rule in EED because sometimes time makes things worse; some people might become extremely disturbed in different circumstances;

      In People v. Cassassa court accepted the first prong, that D was sincerely really emotionally disturbed because he had been rejected; but court said that his conduct was not reasonable even if seen from his subjective viewpoint.  

      The word provocation does not appear in NYPL or in MPC. There are no elements of justification; it doesn’t have a provocation requirement. EED is more of an excuse defense than a justification defense.

      Both MPC and NYPL have EED – what types of murder are mitigated? See above (MPC all and NYPL only intentional)

    **Name of case**
      Issue: whether D’s state of extreme emotional disturbance when he killed V can be considered a reasonable reaction to a series of events sufficient to mitigate the charge of second degree murder to manslaughter.
      Holding: Sentence of murder in the second degree was affirmed.

## Unintentional Killings

  **People v. Knoller | Supreme Court of California, 2007**
    Bane, a dog owned by Marjorie Knoller (D); and Robert Noel (co-D) killed Diane Whipple (V) in the hallway of an apartment building in San Francisco. Bane was one of four huge presa canario dogs Ds wanted to breed and sell as guard dogs/attack dogs. D had been warned that dogs had killed sheep. When D had dogs vaccinated vet said dogs weighed around 100 pounds each and had had no training or discipline of any sort; are therefore “a liability in any household.” Over about 8 months there were 30 episodes of dogs being out of control and threatening humans and other dogs. V lived across lobby from Ds. V on way home. In hallway, Bane attacked her. Neighbor called 911. When police arrived V naked and bleeding and dying. Bled to death. 77 discrete injuries covering body from head to toe. Plaster molds from injuries compared with Bane’s teeth showed that Bane had killed V.
    At trial, D said she did not know dog was dangerous. Said people who had said they were threatened by dogs had been lying. Said she had no idea that Bane would ever do that to anybody.
    Statute: Under CA Penal Code Section 187 subdivision (a), murder is “the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought.” Under CAPC Section 188, “Malice may be either express or implied. It is express when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of a fellow creature. It is implied, when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.”
    At issue here is the definition of “implied malice.” (317)  Implied malice requires a D’s awareness of the risk of death to another (317).
    Malice is implied when the killing is proximately caused by “an act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life” (317)

    By the act of failing to keep Bane in the apartment (omission + duty) D proximately caused the death of the V by deliberately disregarding the danger that the dog  

    Court used People v Thomas test and People v. Philips test. (p. 317). Court prefers Philips – they like both but prefer Philips.

  **People v. Thomas test:**
    Malice is implied when “the defendant for a base, antisocial motive and with wanton disregard for human like, does an act that involves a high probability that it will result in death.”

  **People v. Philips test:**
    Malice is implied when the killing is proximately caused by “an act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life.”

    That D showed no remorse should probably play in sentencing; the defense would argue that it’s not relevant; but people might argue that lack of remorse indicates disregard for life.

    NYPL 125.25(2) says a depraved indifference to human life – second degree murder – similar to malignant and depraved heart in common law. Remember that from our definition of recklessness (see NYPL sec 15.05) have to be aware of the risk and consciously take that risk. Depraved indifference is a step higher because one simply does not care.

    **People v. Suarez (NY)**
      “depraved indifference is best understood as an utter disregard for the value of human life – a willingness to act not because one intends harm but because one simply doesn’t care whether grievous harm results or not. (note 4 p. 319)

    **Manslaughter in the first degree NY 125.20 (1) “with intent to cause” note difference with NY 120.20:**   

      NYPL § 125.20 Manslaughter in the first degree
      A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when:
      1. With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person;

      NYPL § 120.20 Reckless endangerment in the second degree
      A person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the second degree when he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.
      Reckless endangerment in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor.

    **State v. Williams | Court of Appeals of Washington, 1971**
      Native American people. Didn’t take child to doctor. Court is saying that they should have known how serious the illness was. Convicted of negligently causing the death of the child.
      Washington court uses definition of negligence RCW 9.48.150 which requires ordinary deviation from reasonable standard of care.
      Court finds that Ds deviate from what reasonable behavior would be.
      Compare to NYPL 15.05 which requires gross deviation from standard of care.
      NYPL § 15.05 (4). ““Criminal negligence.” A person acts with criminal negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.”
      Here, the prosecutor did not have to show that the Ds had knowledge that they were doing anything wrong. MPC struggled with this; negligent homicide is problematic.


## Midterm strategies and review

  Midterm Review: multiple choice
  Prep:
  Create own outline, including information about cases, and study
  Learn crimes/statutes and practice identifying elements
  Practice
  Not only rules from cases but information about cases – relevant facts, relevant statutory language, outcome – to see if I get a question about a similar case I can use this – a few times in class we have paused to take the time to hash out a rule – for example, but-for is a bit difficult to say it as a rule – maybe not as important for the midterm but for the final – statutes that have been relevant look over – NYPL homicide statutes – break down and analyze if I want some practice – but also give me some practice –
  The practice questions we’re doing should help me understand where my outline helps me and where I can improve it.
  Look at the outline as something that is not set in stone; it’s a tool for me to use; put question marks; ask K and M, post on TWEN.
  If I’m missing things in practice questions, go back to outline, is it there, is it in the wrong place;
  Taking Exam:
  Pace yourself
  Read carefully
  Select “best” answer after eliminating answers – not necessarily the 100% answer, but the “best” answer
  M: have scrap paper next to me; write notes about question; I’m looking for something that proves the rule.
  Eliminate two, be stuck with best two answers, then choose.

  Outline issues on scrap paper
  I.	Second degree manslaughter
  A.	Mens rea issues?
  B.	Actus Reus
  a.	Voluntary act
  b.	Statutory elements
  C.	Causation issues? (if result crime)
  a.	Actual cause
  b.	Proximate cause
  (more -see slide)

  1.	State the rule
  2.	Break it down into the elements

  A.	Did taylor recklessly cause the death? “reckless is wehere person is “aware and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk” that the result will occur.
  the risk must be so that disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in that situation.
  B.	Mens rea – if we’re looking we’ere looking at what the specific mens rea word modifies; here the question is did he recklessly cause death.
  a.	Was taylor aware of a substantial and undjjustifiable risk of death?
  i.	Substantial and unjusti risk: was there a gross deviation from a reasonable persons conduct
  b.	Was taylor aware of the risk?
  Did taylor consciously disregard the risk of death?

  1.	Voluntary actus reus:
  a.	Was there a voluntary act? State rule and apply – conscious bodily movement – you don’t want to skip it even if it looks obvious
  2.	Statutory actus reus:
  a.	did “death” result?
  b.	Was the death of “another person”?

  C.	Causation: did Taylor cause the death of the fireman? Explain that need actual cause and proximate cause
  a.	Actual cause: state rule.
  i.	Had taylor not started the fire, the fire would not have occurred
  b.	Proximate cause: was it coincidental or responsive? (I can break it down to quite a few intervening causes. If there’s more than one actor or force that’s the way you can center it.
  i.	Intervening cause 1: coincidental
  Apply rule
  ii.	Intervening cause 2: responsive
  Apply rule
  D.	Conclusion:

  One of the practice questions: rule: guilty when one “damages a special building by intentionally starting a fire or causing an explosion.”

  (I can start with mens rea)

  A.	Mens rea:
  a.	What terms does “intentionally” modify?
  b.	Did taylor intentionally start a fire?
  c.	Is there any mens rea for “damages a special building”? (could argue that “intentionally” does not modify “damages a special building”)
  B.	Actus Reus
  a.	Voluntary act analysis. State rule and apply. If essay question I could say as stated above in mens rea above d satisfies
  b.	Statutory actus reus elements
  i.	“starting a fire” did d start a fire?
  ii.	“damages a special building” Is this building a special building? (this could cause problems – address legality, overbreadth and vagueness issues, stating rules) And what is “damages”?
